         <p>
             Before We sign a contract or write a line of code, our team will spend the necessary
             time needed to understand our product vision.
             The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.
             Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces
             you need.</p>
